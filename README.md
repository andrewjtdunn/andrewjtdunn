# Hey, I'm Andrew ðŸ‘‹

I'm a graduate student in UChicago's [Computational Analysis and Public Policy](https://harris.uchicago.edu/academics/degrees/ms-computational-analysis-public-policy-mscapp) program. I have a passion for data science and experience in the consulting, financial services, and nonprofit sectors. 

I previously worked as a Data Science Research Assistant at [UChicago's Crime Lab](https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/labs/crime), where I supported the evaluation of randomized controlled trials by using natural language processing on video data. Before that, I led the Data Team at [Financial Health Network](https://finhealthnetwork.org/team/andrew-dunn/) as a Senior Manager. 

My coursework at UChicago focuses on using Python, R, and SQL for applied data science. You can see a few of my projects at the links below:

* [Civic Lens website](https://civic-lens.org/). This open source site makes federal public commenting opportunities more accessible for the American public. I am lead backend engineer of this ongoing project, working with Django, PostgreSQL, and Python to manage the data pipeline for the site.

* [Predicting Observed Poverty Levels in Costa Rica](https://github.com/andrewjtdunn/Costa-Rican-Household-Poverty-Level-Prediction). Alongside three teammates, I tested different machine learning models, as well as techniques like ensemble learning, oversampling, and cross-validation to classify household-level poverty using observed characteristics. Our final model approached the top performing Kaggle models with a final Macro F1 score of .42. We summarized our approach and results in a [summary report](https://github.com/andrewjtdunn/Costa-Rican-Household-Poverty-Level-Prediction/blob/main/Summary%20Report.pdf).

* [Comparing a Hardship Index with Evictions in Chicago](https://github.com/uchicago-capp122-winter23/30122-project-apwhy). Using publicly available data, three teammates and I constructed an dashboard using Python and plotly to compare a constructed hardship index with instances of eviction. The resulting interactive data visualization allows the user to examine the index, its data inputs, and eviction data at the zip code-level in Chicago. We summarized our work in an [explanatory report](https://github.com/uchicago-capp122-winter23/30122-project-apwhy/blob/main/proj-paper.pdf).

* [A/B testing of messaging in a fintech app](https://finhealthnetwork.org/research/financial-health-solutions-increasing-savings-with-a-choice-at-onboarding/). I designed and implemented A/B testing of behavioral design-informed messaging in a fintech app, resulting in 31% higher enrollment in automated savings program and 42% greater savings balances for users. 

Other (private) projects include: building an app for a national nonprofit using an LLM to automate previously manual text extraction from hundreds of documents, constructing a data processing pipeline and testing different machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy of predicted policing outcomes by 40%, and improving a customer classification model for a B2B fintech company.
